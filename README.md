This project is an example of investigation of bookmakers odds accuracy. The purpose of the project was to investigate if it was possible to obtain a stable income by betting on football events.
The bookamker taken in consideration in this analysis is Williamhill. The odds taken in conideration are the "H2H" and the "under/over 2.5".
In the file "sport_odds_data.csv" are reported the odds and the outcome of every match played in the season 2023/24 in the five major european football leagues (Only few matches at the beginning of the season are missing).

Data in this file is then analysed in the "new_analysis.ipynb" script, where a report for each team is generated and stored in the file "new_combined_data.csv". In this file, for each team are calculated the wins, draws, losses, under/over 2.5 for each game it played.

In the remaining files, further analysis is performed to actually see if it is possible to beat the bookmaker.
As of today, there is no evidence that is possible to obtain a stable income by betting against the bookmaker.
